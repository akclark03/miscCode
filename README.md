### Here is some code that I wrote actively learning to program

I taught myself python through the use of multiple free resources online 
* [Dataquest.io](https://app.dataquest.io/)
* [Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org/)
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
* [The Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/)
* [The Cryptopals Crypto Challenge](https://cryptopals.com/)

I have also developed proficiency in Java through the completion of CSC 116 (Intro to Computing - Java) at North Carolina State University
