# In a tic tac toe game, the “game server” needs to know where the Xs and Os are in the board, to know whether player 1 or player 2 (or whoever is X and O won).

# The next logical step is to deal with handling user input. When a player (say player 1, who is X) wants to place an X on the screen, they can’t just click on a terminal.
# So we are going to approximate this clicking simply by asking the user for a coordinate of where they want to place their piece.

# For this exercise, assume that player 1 (the first player to move) will always be X and player 2 (the second player) will always be O.
# Notice how in the example I gave coordinates for where I want to move starting from (1, 1) instead of (0, 0).
# Ask the user to enter coordinates in the form “row,col” - a number, then a comma, then a number.
# Then you can use your Python skills to figure out which row and column they want their piece to be in.
# Don’t worry about checking whether someone won the game, but if a player tries to put a piece in a game position where there already is another piece, do not allow the piece to go there.
# 
# Bonus:
# For the “standard” exercise, don’t worry about “ending” the game - no need to keep track of how many squares are full. In a bonus version,
# keep track of how many squares are full and automatically stop asking for moves when there are no more valid moves.
