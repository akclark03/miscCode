# You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100. The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.

# At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it took to get your number.

# As the writer of this program, you will have to choose how your program will strategically guess.
# A naive strategy can be to simply start the guessing at 1, and keep going (2, 3, 4, etc.) until you hit the number.
# But that’s not an optimal guessing strategy ... After you’ve written the program, try to find the optimal strategy!
